👋 Hey! I’m Masum 
I’m an Android developer from India 🇮🇳 who enjoys building real-world products that are clean, scalable, and pleasant to use.
I love taking ideas from “what if?” to working software — focusing not just on features, but also on architecture, performance, and maintainable code. I care about writing code that other developers (including future me 😄) can actually enjoy working with.
Most of what I’ve learned comes from hands-on building and the open-source community. I really appreciate how developers share knowledge, collaborate, and help each other grow — and I try to do the same whenever I can.
💼 Open to work & collaborations
If you’re looking for someone who can own features, think in systems, and ship reliably, let’s talk.
📧 Feel free to reach out via email.
💬 Need help or want to chat?
Ask me anything — tech, architecture, or random dev stuff. Always happy to connect.
